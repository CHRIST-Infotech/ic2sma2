                CHRIST (Deemed to be University) was born out of the educational vision of St Kuriakose Elias Chavara,
                an educationalist and social reformer of the nineteenth century in South India. He founded the first
                Catholic indigenous congregation, Carmelites of Mary Immaculate (CMI), in 1831, which administers CHRIST
                (Deemed to be University). The institution began as CHRIST College in 1969 and grew gradually in numbers
                and infrastructure. It gained a reputation for its outstanding academic achievements. In 2004, The
                University Grants Commission (UGC) of India conferred Autonomy to the college, and it was identified as
                an Institution with Potential for Excellence in 2006. It was declared an institution deemed a university
                by the Ministry of Education on 22 July 2008. The off-site campuses offer several UG, PG, and
                doctoral-level programmes in Commerce, Law, Data Science, Languages and Management. Equipped with
                state-of-the-art facilities and highly qualified faculty, the Analytical Hub aims to help students
                achieve academic excellence through diverse teaching methodologies, modern curricula and innovative
                research practices. CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Lavasa promotes a culture that embodies the
                philosophy of ‘Excellence and Service’. It is designed to promote holistic education and hone individual
                talents to encourage all-round development of the students.

                meeting IMA’s Higher Education Quality Standards. The Department of Commerce has also consistently
