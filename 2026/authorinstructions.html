                    <div>
                        Indent all paragraphs except those following a section heading. An indent should be at least 2
                        em-spaces.
                        <br />
                        Do not insert extra space between paragraphs of text with the exception of long quotations,
                        theorems, propositions, special remarks, etc. These should be set off from the surrounding text
                        by
                        additional space above and below.
                        <br />
                        Don't "widow" or "orphan" text (i.e., ending a page with the first line of a paragraph or
                        beginning
                        a page with the last line of a paragraph).
                        <br />
                        All text should be left-justified (i.e., flush with the left margin—except where indented).
                        Where
                        possible, it should also be right-justified (i.e., flush with the right margin). "Where
                        possible"
                        refers to the quality of the justification. For example, LaTeX and TeX do an excellent job of
                        justifying text. Word does a reasonable job. But some word processors do a lousy job (e.g., they
                        achieve right justification by inserting too much white space within and between words). We
                        prefer
                        flush right margins. However, it is better to have jagged right margins than to have flush right
                        margins with awkward intra- and inter-word spacing. Make your decision on whichever looks best.

                        Because this conference publishes electronically, page limits are not as relevant as they are in
                        the
                        world of print publications. We are happy, therefore, to let authors take advantage of this
                        greater
                        "bandwidth" to include material that they might otherwise have to cut to get into a print
                        journal.
                        This said, authors should exercise some discretion with respect to length, especially given that
                        reviewers generally prefer reading short, concise, right-to-the-point manuscripts.

                        Set the font color to black for the text. We encourage authors to take advantage of the ability

                        use color in the production of figures, maps, etc., however, you need to appreciate that this

                        cause some of your readers problems when they print the document on a black & white printer. For
                        this reason, you are advised to avoid the use of colors in situations where their translation to
                        black and white would render the material illegible or incomprehensible.

                        should be single spaced, and there should be a footnote separator rule (line). Footnote numbers
                        or

                        are
                        probably better handled in an appendix. All footnotes should be left and right-justified (i.e.,

                        of overly small type in tables. In no case should tables or figures be in a separate document or

                        right)

                        as part of multi-letter function names should not be italicized. Whenever possible, subscripts

                        math. Also expressions using many different levels (e.g., such as the fractions) should be set
                        as
                        display math. Important definitions or concepts can also be set off as display math.
                        <br />
                        Equations should be numbered sequentially. Whether equation numbers are on the right or left is
                        the
                        choice of the author(s). However, you are expected to be consistent in this.
                        <br />
                        Symbols and notation in unusual fonts should be avoided. This will not only enhance the clarity
                        of
                        the manuscript, but it will also help insure that it displays correctly on the reader's screen
                        and
                        prints correctly on her printer. When proofing your document under PDF pay particular attention
                        to
                        the rendering of the mathematics, especially symbols and notation drawn from other than standard
